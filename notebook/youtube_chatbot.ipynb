            "Liquidity. She must have heard this word so many times in the world of trading that you might be confused about what it actually is and how to use it. In today's video, I will completely clarify what the concept of liquidity is, what a liquidity sweep is and how to develop it in a trading strategy. First, I will explain it to you with examples from daily life so that you can understand liquidity. After that, we will put it on technical and understand it in an advanced way. So, let's start the video, guys. [Music] So guys, we will first come to the iPad and understand what is liquidity. Liquidity means how easily you can buy or sell something. So let's understand it like a story. Suppose you go to a shop for your own business purpose like if you are a big buyer a big businessman think in the way institutional people might think like FISD or big investors might think that you go to a shop a big shop and you ask for 100 iPhones but they have 90 available here it doesn't match liquidity is low but you go to another shop after that let's say the broker is being discussed you go to XNES you go to Delta you go to some other broker let's talk in this way you go to buy 100 phones he says I have 1,000 available You tell me. So the second shop, shop number two here, liquidity is very much available. Large scale business is not possible if there is no liquidity. So how will this connect to trading? We will understand. We heard the story. You can take a simple iPhone or anything as an example. Now if I connect this to my trading world, look, the liquidity is of the iPhone. But now you start negotiating with it. You entered shop number two through the broker. For example, there are 1,000 iPhones. Now you say, \"Give them, brother.\" They say, \"No, brother. I will only give you 50 iPhones. It is 1 lakh rupees. After that, if you want 50, then 1 lakh 1,000. I like that. So, the price is changing. As per the price, liquidity is changing. That is the quantity you want to buy is available, but it's costly. If you're a buyer, now let's consider if you're a seller. Imagine from a seller's perspective, you approach him with 1,000 iPhones and say you want to sell them. He responds, I'll take a 100 for 99,000 rupees. The next 100 I will sell it to you for 98,000. So the price is dropping here due to the seller and rising outside due to basic trading concepts. But I hope you understand the meaning of liquidity having the facility to buy and sell regardless of the quantity available. This is liquidity. Now let's link this to your trading strategies. Let me break it down on my tablet. I will then take you to the charts. And I am making this video because the next video is advanced trading strategy. Sniper headshot strategy. This refers to a strategy that has less entries but when it activates it is equal to a headshot. Comment strategy video if you are interested and actually I am making it for this reason because in that video I don't want to explain in detail what liquidity is because the best strategy regarding liquidity will be that one. So just common strategy and let's understand it here. I will explain it in detail. I will give a direct trading strategy but we will go to the charts later. Let's come back. Suppose a wave or any market structure is forming here. Meaning the market is moving in a certain way for example. So what does liquidity mean? Liquidity means where orders are present here. Where orders are pending. We will talk about technical trading later. Liquidity is simply where there are many buy and sell orders. So if a person or a large company wants to buy, they find a seller. And if someone wants to sell they find a buyer. Now let's understand where these are. If we look at this structure carefully I will start drawing the main lines here. So the simple resistance demand zone supply zone. I drew a line here and draw a few lines here too. Let me draw this in different color. I'm pulling this. It's a bit different. Okay. And okay. If we look at its chart on a 15minut time frame then we will get liquidity here which we can call external liquidity. We can call it internal liquidity. We will change its color for internal liquidity and also start understanding the difference between internal and external. This is internal liquidity. So now let's only talk about external. What happens is guys whenever the market needs a big move suppose the market mood here is to dump to sell. So now we look from the sell point of view where do we prefer? We always prefer to sell here which everyone knows. Now let's understand upwards here. Look brother, there is resistance here. It means some selling has happened here. Selling has been done here. A lot of selling has happened here. The market is pausing here because it is a sell point. Right now there is a lot of selling. Short sellers are active. They want to sell. For example, even big people want to sell. Who knows? Maybe even small people. We don't know who wants to sell yet because the market has gone a bit sideways. This structure has formed. Now what happens? Have all the people who have shorted here placed their stop-loss orders here? Stop-lo-s order right now. stop-loss order. If someone buys, what does their sell become? Its SL becomes an exit. So the person who has sold like someone has shorted, where would their SL be placed? Tell me what would their sell mean? When a short trader exits, they have to buy to exit. So a short trader's exit becomes a buy. Okay. So the traders who have been trading already would understand that a short trader stop-loss is a buy order. So guys, what is happening here is that there are many buy orders already placed in terms of stop- losses. Now what happens? Look, the big companies want to sell. They are in the mood to sell here. That's why the market wasn't able to break. They wait for the market to come and you'll see a very nice breakout. No, not like that. The market reached here. A very small breakout happens. This small breakout triggers all their SLS. And as it triggers all their SLs, there is a lot of buy order liquidity here. it becomes available. Seeing these small breakouts, many small traders, retail traders press the buy button here. Liquidity from a new trader is also coming in. Now look, there are many buy orders. So liquidity is available. Assume the big company got liquidity for 10,000 lots by shorting. They will execute an order of 10,000 lots here at once. By doing a,000 at different prices, the market starts to fall like this. Here the money is made with a very small stop-loss. and you enter here and get a big target. So what happened here? External liquidity was grabbed meaning it was actually outside the structure and there you get a big move. So this is a method of grabbing on a 5minut time frame even on a 15minut time frame which we call liquidity. Here this is called a liquidity sweep or a liquidity grab. The meaning of both words liquidity sweep in simple words sweep means to clean up clean up. All liquidity was taken away by buying orders and selling and it was dropped down. Now let's dive into market structure. Observe the market and you'll see that everyone has a different understanding of it. Sometimes it takes support and moves sideways. What happens is people think hey the market is doing well here and then it gives a slight breakout upwards from here. It makes us feel that the market has taken good support here. Now there are many buyers in the market here. Okay. In this area internal liquidity will form and in this area external liquidity will form. There are heavy short stop losses placed here. Meaning if the market comes here they will exit. How will they exit? It's obvious that so many people whose stop- loss will be hit or hunted. Sell orders will accumulate here. Sell orders will come into the market into the open market. So now what happens is that the big players want to buy in the market that's why they were buying there and the market went up. But what happens now is that they are not finding enough sellers. Suppose they need to pick up 50,000 lots here. Now to pick up 50,000 lots, someone also needs to sell 50,000 lots. No, it's not that no one is selling, but they would have to buy at a high price. They don't want to buy at a high price. They are not like us who just wake up, wash our face, and start trading. They plan their trades thoroughly. So they are planning, we need it at the right price. So what do they do? They deliberately do not punch their buy orders. They wait to see what the market does. When there are big players, the market goes sideways breaking upper levels and hitting stop- losses. Now what happens is as soon as the market reaches a big level and people buy, it breaks it as the SL level is hit. Tell me what will happen. A lot of sell orders came in. Let us assume we get 30,000 sell lots here. They see this opportunity. We needed to buy 50,000 lots. 30,000 lots are bought here. Sell orders have come in here. they are ready to buy these 30,000 lots because people are forced to sell 30,000 lots. This compulsion is taken advantage of. All this liquidity is swept up or bought and the market gives a breakout upwards and as soon as the opportunity arises they add another 20,000 lots and the market pumps up. So what happens right the retailer also thinks here like brother I should buy here or I wish I had bought here bought here bought here bought here I have also bought here but they don't have enough money to withstand such a big stop-loss or their risk management will break otherwise so some people exit here for risk management some people ruin their accounts and get this big move so again the external liquidity is the main thing you can trade the liquidity of smaller levels on a one minute time frame I will show it on the chart but traders who use the standard 15 and 5 minute time frame and want to take good trades should always pay attention to external liquidity. So now I hope that the meaning of liquidity has become clear to you here. I will take you to my laptop and there I will show you some examples in Bitcoin and gold. And now look now I will take you to the gold chart. See what happens in the market is assume that you are seeing only this part. How much? See the market comes here takes support takes resistance takes resistance takes support takes support. Now see all the people who have bought here have their SLS placed here. SL means sell order. Then sell order. Now everyone sees that there is support here. So everyone is placing SL's here. Placing SL's. Placing SLs. What does the market do? The buyer has to pick up. The buyer wants to purchase. He won't buy intentionally because he is getting it expensive here and there aren't enough sellers. Now where do I arrange sellers from? When the market breaks a support, a retail trader thinks the support is broken. So they decide to sell. They press the sell button. Plus there has been an exit. All the people who were here got caught up in it already. Many sell orders have come in. Plus seeing this breakdown. New retailers enter. And the sell is good. We had to buy 20,000 lots. The 20,000 were not selling back. So if the rally comes like this, which closes above my circle, bro, you have to buy here. If you look at the stop loss, you get a big wave showing that the market gave a move of about $20 in gold from 2,926. It's a big move. So this is how the concept of liquidity works. I will tell you about this trading strategy. Don't worry, I'll provide clear steps for entry. Step one, step two, step three. Now, let's explore further. What is the market doing? Everyone can see there's resistance. There's resistance. It's resistance. So, what's happening in the trade in the 50-minut time frame? Resistance. It is resistance. It is resistance. Okay. Now, what are you seeing? There is resistance. If the market's mood here becomes to dump, then obviously there was a time on the 21st of February. Now, it is the 21st to 24th of February. Every day is not the same for traders or investors moods. They're changing their situations based on their own goals. And there you always feel like sir how is it possible to buy now and then sell now look in the market fas are not just one a company that rules the market is just one among thousands of foreign institutional investors and it's not just one country like America China or Japan everyone trades in gold so you cannot nobody can rule the market but yes they do win over retail because they are disciplined so let's understand the market's mood here what does the market do it breaks as it breaks it wraps up all their stop- losses those who were sitting after selling here as As soon as they wrapped up the stop loss, a rally formed. Many retail traders came here and placed buy orders. New retail traders placed buy orders. B1 B2 liquidity is let's say 10,000 15,000 lots. They had to short here. They shorted. Now see the market takes a wave from there and gives such a big fall here and even before this wave I tell you the same concept works in 5 minutes too. I bring it here to show you even in 5 minutes if you look the market was falling before falling it does a breakout once more. See how big the candle is forming downward. A big candle downward. Small candles are visible again. Small candles breakout happen. First confirmation here. Sell. If you sell here, you see the benefit of trading liquidity is that you get a fast move first. You don't have to wait long. Plus stop-loss versus target. You always even if I take it up to here, I remember getting one is to two. And if I try to take the next levels here, like if these are my next levels, for example, then I am getting 1 is to 2.7. If there is a big move then let's see how much it went. If we look at riskreward even if we can't take it we should at least know what riskreward can be achieved sometimes. So here riskreward is practically possible at 1 to six. But if you become a good trader in 2 to 3 months from now you can achieve 1 is to three or four. The same concept works everywhere. It will work in the Indian market too. But let's look at Bitcoin now. If we look at Bitcoin's chart here when Bitcoin has to move up see how nicely it does. People are buying. People are buying. People are buying. They said, \"Yay, hey, people are buying.\" But right now, the big players told us we need to buy 50. Who will sell? Many people will sell if you give them at 105,000. If you give them at 110,000, if you give them in one lakh $2,000, but they want to buy at a cheap price. Why? Every buyer wants a cheap price. So, what they do is they let the market push downwards here. Okay? The market comes downwards and gives a jerk upwards at closing. Now see when it came down what happened? All their SLS happened. Their stop loss got hit. All 50,000 100,000 bitcoins were picked up. And here we got a nice upward rally. This usually happens before a big rally. Now guys, we see a strong crash in Bitcoin. It's a great buying opportunity for investors. For traders, they should plan for selling right now. We can talk about all this later when I come live. And guys, I have a telegram channel. Do check it out. I am giving very good market guidance there. Don't miss it. Make sure to join it. If you are a new trader then press the subscribe button and also press the notification button. All right, let's move on. Now look what is here. There is resistance. The market is falling. What does the market do again? It hits the stop-loss. Invites the poor retail trader. In fact, I myself went long here. So, my own stop-loss was hit. So, when the stop loss was hit, I bought so many buy orders came in. They have to dump sell 100,000 Bitcoin. With such a big crash happening, I hope the concept of liquidity has been understood. I think you might not have understood how to trade using this concept. I will explain it properly in the next advanced trading video. So keep an eye out for that. I hope you liked the video uh and learned something new. If you are not familiar with me, I have 7 to 8 years of experience in trading. You can see such a large team and workspace where I conduct research. I come up with new strategies and back test them. I trade live. I my FX book link is public. If you want to learn from me, make sure to subscribe to this channel. If you subscribe, you will sometimes find me live and I will share many things with you. I have a telegram channel where so many people are already using my market guidance for free. This is my application called market genius. Here you get a calculator. You get forex market analysis. You also find out when high impact news is coming. In the end, if you have experience and are in this market, I also have a VIP community, a paid community, and at a very low cost like $78, you get my very good trades. Anyway, use the free things first and if you wish, you can simply go to mgvip.group and check for yourself. You will find all these links in the description as well.

This refers to a strategy that has less entries but when it activates it is equal to a headshot. Comment strategy video if you are interested and actually I am making it for this reason because in that video I don't want to explain in detail what liquidity is because the best strategy regarding liquidity will be that one. So just common strategy and let's understand it here. I will explain it in detail. I will give a direct trading strategy but we will go to the charts later. Let's come back.

And if someone wants to sell they find a buyer. Now let's understand where these are. If we look at this structure carefully I will start drawing the main lines here. So the simple resistance demand zone supply zone. I drew a line here and draw a few lines here too. Let me draw this in different color. I'm pulling this. It's a bit different. Okay. And okay. If we look at its chart on a 15minut time frame then we will get liquidity here which we can call external liquidity. We can call it internal liquidity.

              "'the meaning of liquidity having the facility to buy and sell regardless of the quantity available. This is liquidity. Now let\\'s link this to your trading strategies. Let me break it down on my tablet. I will then take you to the charts. And I am making this video because the next video is advanced trading strategy. Sniper headshot strategy. This refers to a strategy that has less entries but when it activates it is equal to a headshot. Comment strategy video if you are interested and actually I am making it for this reason because in that video I don\\'t want to explain in detail what liquidity is because the best strategy regarding liquidity will be that one. So just common strategy and let\\'s understand it here. I will explain it in detail. I will give a direct trading strategy but we will go to the charts later. Let\\'s come back. Suppose a wave or any market structure is forming here. Meaning the market is moving in a certain way for example. So what does liquidity mean? Liquidity\\n\\nyou start negotiating with it. You entered shop number two through the broker. For example, there are 1,000 iPhones. Now you say, \"Give them, brother.\" They say, \"No, brother. I will only give you 50 iPhones. It is 1 lakh rupees. After that, if you want 50, then 1 lakh 1,000. I like that. So, the price is changing. As per the price, liquidity is changing. That is the quantity you want to buy is available, but it\\'s costly. If you\\'re a buyer, now let\\'s consider if you\\'re a seller. Imagine from a seller\\'s perspective, you approach him with 1,000 iPhones and say you want to sell them. He responds, I\\'ll take a 100 for 99,000 rupees. The next 100 I will sell it to you for 98,000. So the price is dropping here due to the seller and rising outside due to basic trading concepts. But I hope you understand the meaning of liquidity having the facility to buy and sell regardless of the quantity available. This is liquidity. Now let\\'s link this to your trading strategies. Let me break it down on my\\n\\npeople exit here for risk management some people ruin their accounts and get this big move so again the external liquidity is the main thing you can trade the liquidity of smaller levels on a one minute time frame I will show it on the chart but traders who use the standard 15 and 5 minute time frame and want to take good trades should always pay attention to external liquidity. So now I hope that the meaning of liquidity has become clear to you here. I will take you to my laptop and there I will show you some examples in Bitcoin and gold. And now look now I will take you to the gold chart. See what happens in the market is assume that you are seeing only this part. How much? See the market comes here takes support takes resistance takes resistance takes support takes support. Now see all the people who have bought here have their SLS placed here. SL means sell order. Then sell order. Now everyone sees that there is support here. So everyone is placing SL\\'s here. Placing SL\\'s. Placing\\n\\nway institutional people might think like FISD or big investors might think that you go to a shop a big shop and you ask for 100 iPhones but they have 90 available here it doesn\\'t match liquidity is low but you go to another shop after that let\\'s say the broker is being discussed you go to XNES you go to Delta you go to some other broker let\\'s talk in this way you go to buy 100 phones he says I have 1,000 available You tell me. So the second shop, shop number two here, liquidity is very much available. Large scale business is not possible if there is no liquidity. So how will this connect to trading? We will understand. We heard the story. You can take a simple iPhone or anything as an example. Now if I connect this to my trading world, look, the liquidity is of the iPhone. But now you start negotiating with it. You entered shop number two through the broker. For example, there are 1,000 iPhones. Now you say, \"Give them, brother.\" They say, \"No, brother. I will only give you 50'"
